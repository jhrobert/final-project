    <h2> Welcome! </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">Hey. We're gonna learn you some code. I hope you got your coding socks on. Cause I'm gonna knock them off. Watch out. 
Ya know what we got? We got some HTML. You love HTML. I know you do. Come on, man, you've been doing HTML for years. You guys go way back. 
We got some CSS too. Ya know, fine, CSS isn't as cool. I get it. But you gotta know it. It's important. Makes things pretty. Art and whatnot. What's your favorite artist?
Oh and PHP. Got a nice table for that one. Check it out. Boom bam. PHP. It does things. It resembles Javascript. Its name is recursive, and that's kinda freaky.
Also, sign up for our newsletter. We send you a new php element every day. I'm not sure if we actually do that.</p>
